# Dungeon Realms: Campaign Toolkit

## Introduction
Welcome, adventurer! This repository is a toolkit designed to bring the spirit of Dungeons & Dragons into a structured, digital form. Whether you are a Dungeon Master preparing encounters or a player tracking your characterâ€™s journey, this project aims to simplify the game behind the game.  

At its heart, this toolkit provides modules for:  
- Character creation and progression  
- Encounter building and combat management  
- Rules and dice-rolling automation  
- Campaign notes, quests, and NPC tracking  

It is built to be modular, so you can use only what you need or expand it with homebrew content.

## Features
- **Character Builder**: Create, level up, and manage characters.  
- **Combat Manager**: Track initiative, conditions, and resolve dice rolls.  
- **Content Library**: Access monsters, spells, and items from JSON/YAML packs.  
- **Campaign Log**: Keep notes, track sessions, and export summaries.  
- **Customisation**: Add homebrew monsters, magic items, and house rules.

## Roadmap
- Expand GUI support for easier session management.  
- Add PDF export for character sheets and encounter summaries.
